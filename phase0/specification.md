For phase 1, we will create a program that simulates a real estate platform with buyers and sellers. Sellers will be able to list properties on the platform by providing the address of the property, its price, and other relevant features such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of stories, and so forth. Buyers will then be able to use a series of commands to view a list of properties that may interest them. The functionality that we will be adding includes listing properties by price point, by location, and by the features mentioned above such as number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of stories, etc. Sellers will also be able to remove their properties from the programâ€™s property list. For further extension, our group hopes to add more varied types of properties to the program such as apartments and condominiums.

Alongside this, we will be allowing buyers to place offers on properties that they like, and when sellers login to the program they will be able to view offers that they have received and accept or reject them. For later phases of the project, if time permits, our group is planning on adding a graphical user interface that maps the list of properties onto a map and allows users to click on property icons to learn more about a particular listing.
